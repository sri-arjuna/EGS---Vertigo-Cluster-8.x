If you would like to have your starter planet, 
with your blueprints, as well, please consider
that there must be a coherent style of spreading
your themed blueprints across the planet/orbit/moon.


These are required groups to participate (replace ERA with your brandname):
Syntax: <BRAND>-<TYPE>(-Start)
* ERA-BA
* ERA-BA-Start (up to lvl 10)
* ERA-HV
* ERA-HV-Start (up to lvl 7)
* ERA-SV
* ERA-SV-Start (up to lvl 10, no Cobalt, no Sathium)
* ERA-CV
* ERA-CV-Start (up to lvl 10)


For filenames it would be great to have them this way:
ERA-CV-NAME-DESC
ERA-HV-Scarab-L7-MK500


Additional and optional, if you have any POIs, you wold like to share / see in the scenario, here's a recomend group syntax:


Friendly / Civil (no turret/sentry) weapons:
Syntax: <BRAND>-POI-<NAME>
* ERA-POI-Civhub
* ERA-POI-TS
* ERA-POI-TSO
* ERA-POI-Space


Military / Hostile:
Syntax: <BRAND>-POI-<NAME>-<DIFFICULTY>
ERA-POI-Defence-T1
ERA-POI-Aux-T2

Upon offering your blueprints, once included and successfully tested, you'll be added to the creators/participants of the scenario.

Furthermore, you get to choose a starterplanet type and your enemy! (if you want) :)
